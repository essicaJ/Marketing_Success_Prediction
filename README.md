# Marketing_Success_Prediction
## Project Overview
This project aims to use various characteristics of clients in a Bank Marketing dataset to predict if the client subscribed to the term deposit. 

I will use this data to build a surpervised ML binary classification model to predict marketing success using Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost

Achieved 94% test accuracy with grid-search and oversampling to optimize models
